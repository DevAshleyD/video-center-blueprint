	<description_html>&lt;p&gt;PS MESSAGE FROM PROF MORIARTY: "I misspoke for the last sentence of the video. What I meant to say is that the photons don&amp;#39;t have enough energy to excite electrons across the energy gap and therefore light is transmitted. What I said was precisely the opposite, contradicting everything else in the video. Apologies for any confusion caused."&lt;/p&gt;</description_html>
